On the Friday evening, we had a 20-minute slot on Stage 3, and then we had another 10-minute slot on Saturday to compete in what was called the &quot;Club Tent Competition&quot;. The winner of said competition would go on to perform on Stage 1 (the big one!) later that weekend. Unfortunately we didn't win that competition, but it was still such a good opportunity for us.</p> <p>As a band, we all got Artist badges and everything! Definitely an experience to remember.</p> <p>Overall, I had a really good time, and I'd like to thank everyone who helped to make it an amazing experience for me.</p> <h4 id="ugh-activities-week"><a href="#ugh-activities-week" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ugh, Activities Week.</h4> <p>At school this week, they've held &quot;Activities Week&quot;. According to them, this is a &quot;carousel of exciting activities&quot;. Honestly, I'd have to disagree - mainly just an excuse for teachers to have a week off, and waste time!</p> <p>We started the week with a STEM challenge - building a bridge. Let me just tell you now, this bridge was a total flop. It could hardly hold the weight that it needed to, and it looked absolutely awful. Not my finest creation!</p> <p>For the second half of Tuesday, we walked for half an hour to Angelsey Abbey, a National Trust property just down the road from school. Bit boring, but it was nice to spend time with my friends.</p> <p>On Wednesday, we were sent to work with our parents. Since I can't go to Dad's work because of company policies, and I'm honestly a bit bored of working at Mum's cafe, I went to work with a friend of Mum's called James. He's very nice, and I had a good time at his office (Sartorius Stedim Biotech). Thanks for having me!</p> <p>On Thursday, we spent the day doing &quot;fun&quot; activities. These were mainly aimed at kids completing DofE, which was helpful for me! Well - they were supposed to be helpful. Guess where we walked? Angelsey Abbey! Again!</p> <p>On Friday, my half of the year visited Aldeburgh. I wasn't at school today, though.</p> <h3 id="that-s-about-it"><a href="#that-s-about-it" class="header-anchor">#</a> That's about it!</h3></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
